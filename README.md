## stoneages-dot-me

This is my personal homepage. It was bootstraped with `create-react-app` because:
- I wanted to try evaluating the pros and cons of using it on a serious (it will be deployed!) and long-term (it will be maintained and added to over time!) project, and can't think of anything else at this moment which would qualify for both, because I am a dearth of ideas
- Why not

As I create more projects and expand my online presence, new elements will be added to this space. Whatever one sees now is always, just like the stories of our lives, a work in progress. Come back later and you may be surprised.

Humble beginnings, let's go.
