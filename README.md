## stoneages-dot-me

This is my personal homepage. It was bootstraped with `create-react-app` in 2018. I'm aware that many of its components are now out of date. I haven't decided whether it is better to upgrade everything or to re-write the entire site from scratch. Though I tend towards the latter based on technical considerations, I've been lacking inspiration regarding a potential redesign and "personal rebranding" process which that may involve.

Regarding contents and presentation of information: the "story" section has been updated to something that feels genuine and authentic as of this point in time. The rest feels like it could be revamped entirely / structurally, but in the absence of ideas of what to replace it with, it will just remain as it is.
